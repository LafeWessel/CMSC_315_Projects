TestBST contains the directory locations for:
	- dictionary word file name : dictName
	- dictionary word file folder : dictLoc
	- text file folder : txtFolder
	- print debug statements : DEBUG (most have just been commented out)

TestBST will read in the dictionary file and generate an appropriate BST.
After, it will prompt the user for input and give directions on adding, removing, spellchecking and
exiting the program, as well as printing the dictionary (will only print if < 50 items in it).

TestSpellChecker will read in the dictionary file and generate an appropriate BST. After,
it will create an ArrayList of the elements in the file and determine if any elements are 
missing from the BST that are in the ArrayList.
